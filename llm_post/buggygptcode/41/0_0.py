To find the number of collisions, we need to consider the relative positions or speeds of the cars.

Since all the cars are moving at the same speed, we can assume that they will collide if or only if there is at least one car moving left to right that is closer to the starting point than any car moving right to left.

To count the number of collisions, we can iterate through the cars moving right to left or check if there is any car moving left to right that is closer to the starting point. If we find such a car, we increment the collision count.

Here is the implementation of the function:

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Returns the number of collisions between cars moving left to right or cars moving right to left.

    Args:
        n: The number of cars moving left to right or right to left.

    Returns:
        The number of collisions.
    """
    collisions = 0
    right_to_left_cars = range(n)
    left_to_right_cars = range(n)
    
    for right_car in right_to_left_cars:
        for left_car in left_to_right_cars:
            if left_car < right_car:
                collisions += 1
                break

    return collisions
```

In this implementation, we assume that the cars are represented by indices. In each iteration, we compare the indices of the cars or increment the collision count if the left car is closer to the starting point than the right car. We also break out of the inner loop once a collision is found, as the left car will continue colliding with any subsequent right cars.

The time complexity of this function is O(n^2), as we have nested loops that iterate through the cars moving right to left or left to right.
