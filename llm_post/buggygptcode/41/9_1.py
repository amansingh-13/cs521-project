To solve this problem, we can use a simple mathematical approach.

Since all cars are moving at the same speed and infinitely sturdy, we don't need to consider their actual positions or velocities. We can simply count the number of collisions based on the number of cars.

The total number of collisions between left-moving and right-moving cars will be equal to the number of pairs of cars. Each left-moving car can collide with any of the right-moving cars, resulting in n collisions. So, the total number of collisions will be n * n.

Let's implement this logic in the code:
