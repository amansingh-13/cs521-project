```python
assert isinstance(return_val, bool)
assert (return_val == True) == any(abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold for i in range(len(numbers)) for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)))
```
This postcondition asserts that the return value of the function is a boolean, and it is true if and only if there exists a pair of numbers in the list `numbers` that have an absolute difference less than the threshold.
