```python
assert isinstance(return_val, Tuple)  # The return value should be a tuple
assert len(return_val) == 2  # The tuple should have exactly two elements

assert isinstance(return_val[0], int)  # The first element of the tuple should be an integer
assert isinstance(return_val[1], int)  # The second element of the tuple should be an integer

assert sum(numbers) == return_val[0]  # The first element of the tuple should be the sum of the numbers in the input list
assert return_val[1] == 1  # The second element of the tuple should be 1 if the input list is empty

if numbers:
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    assert product == return_val[1]  # The second element of the tuple should be the product of the numbers in the input list
