```python
# Postcondition: The return value is a list of strings where each string represents a separate group of nested parentheses from the input paren_string. Each group in the return value is balanced, meaning that each open parenthesis is properly closed. Additionally, each group in the return value is not nested within any other group. The return value does not contain any spaces.
assert isinstance(return_val, list)
assert all(isinstance(group, str) for group in return_val)
assert all(group.count('(') == group.count(')') for group in return_val)
assert all('(' not in group and ')' not in group for group in return_val)
