```python
assert isinstance(return_val, list)
assert all(isinstance(level, int) for level in return_val)
assert len(return_val) == len(paren_string.split())
```
The postcondition asserts that the return value is a list, with each element being an integer. It also checks that the length of the return value is equal to the number of groups in the input string.
