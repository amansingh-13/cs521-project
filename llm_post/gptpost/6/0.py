```python
def parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:
    """ Input to this function is a string represented multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces.
    For each of the group, output the deepest level of nesting of parentheses.
    E.g. (()()) has maximum two levels of nesting while ((())) has three.
    
    >>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
    [2, 3, 1, 3]
    """
    
    return_val = []  # Hypothetical return value
    
    # CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION WITH ASSERT HERE
    
    return return_val
```

```python
assert isinstance(return_val, list)
```

This postcondition asserts that the hypothetical return value `return_val` is of type `list`. This ensures that the function will always return a list as specified in the function signature.
