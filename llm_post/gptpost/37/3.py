    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd indicies, while its values at the even indicies are equal
    to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.
    >>> sort_even([1, 2, 3])

    CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION WITH ASSERT HERE
```

```python
assert return_val == [l[i] if i % 2 != 0 else sorted([l[j] for j in range(len(l)) if j % 2 == 0]) for i in range(len(l))]
```
The postcondition checks if the return value is equal to a list comprehension that builds a new list based on the given input list `l`. The list comprehension conditionally selects values from `l` based on their indices. If the index is odd, the value is selected as is. If the index is even, the value is sorted by selecting all even indices from `l` and sorting them.
