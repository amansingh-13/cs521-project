```python
def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
    1.0
    """
    n = len(numbers)
    mean = sum(numbers) / n

    # Postcondition
    assert isinstance(return_val, float)
    assert return_val >= 0

    return return_val
```
Explanation: The postcondition asserts that the return value is a float and that it is non-negative, as the mean absolute deviation should always be a non-negative value.
