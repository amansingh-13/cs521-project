```python
assert isinstance(return_val, bool)        # The return value should be a boolean
assert (all(abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) > threshold for i in range(len(numbers)) for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)))) or (return_val == False)   # Either all differences between numbers are greater than threshold or return_val is False
```
