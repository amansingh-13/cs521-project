```python
assert isinstance(return_val, bool)  # The return value should be a boolean
assert all(isinstance(num, float) for num in numbers)  # All elements in the list should be float
assert isinstance(threshold, float)  # The threshold should be a float

# The postcondition checks if the return value is True, then there exists at least two numbers
# in the list that are closer to each other than the given threshold.
if return_val:
    assert any(abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold for i in range(len(numbers)) for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)))
else:
    assert all(abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) >= threshold for i in range(len(numbers)) for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)))
