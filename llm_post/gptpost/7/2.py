```python
assert all(substring in s for s in strings) == all(substring in s for s in return_val)
```
This postcondition checks that for every string `s` in the input list `strings`, `substring` is present in `s`, if and only if, for every string `s` in the hypothetical return value `return_val`, `substring` is present in `s`.
