```python
assert (return_val == any(abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j]) < threshold for i in range(len(numbers)) for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)))) == \
       (any(abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j]) < threshold for i in range(len(numbers)) for j in range(i+1, len(numbers))))
```
This postcondition checks if the hypothetical return value `return_val` is equal to the result of the expression `any(abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j]) < threshold for i in range(len(numbers)) for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)))`. The postcondition also ensures that the expression `any(abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j]) < threshold for i in range(len(numbers)) for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)))` is equal to the actual result of the function.
