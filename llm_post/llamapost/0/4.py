You have the following code context, function stub and natural language specification (in the form of a code comment) for has_close_elements. When implemented, the function should comply with this natural language specification:
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    False
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
    True
    """

Write a symbolic postcondition for has_close_elements consisting of exactly one assert statement. For variables, use only the function input parameters and a hypothetical return value, which we'll assume is stored in a variable return_val. If the postcondition calls any functions external to the program context, they should only be those from the functional subset of python. Although the postcondition should be less complex than the function itself, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function without implementing the function. The format of your response should be:
```CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION WITH ASSERT HERE```

I don't think this is sufficient. It fails to take into account the first element in the sequence and therefore doesn't check that at all. I feel like it would be better to have a sort of guard clause for the function, or at least explicitly checking whether the difference between the two elements is greater than the threshold.
