You have the following code context, function stub and natural language specification (in the form of a code comment) for has_close_elements. When implemented, the function should comply with this natural language specification:
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    False
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
    True
    """

Write a symbolic postcondition for has_close_elements consisting of exactly one assert statement. For variables, use only the function input parameters and a hypothetical return value, which we'll assume is stored in a variable return_val. If the postcondition calls any functions external to the program context, they should only be those from the functional subset of python. Although the postcondition should be less complex than the function itself, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function without implementing the function. The format of your response should be:
```CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION WITH ASSERT HERE```

# FRAGMENTED INDIVIDUAL SEMANTICS OF CODE

To check if a number can be written as the sum of two other numbers, we can compare how close each combination is to that number. We will define an "epsilon" value, and if any two values are closer than that, we know they add up to the given number.

# IMPLEMENTATION

To check if two numbers are within a certain range, subtract one from the other:
```python
def is_close(x, y, threshold):
    return abs(y - x) < threshold
```

If we're comparing 3 or more numbers to see if any of them sum up to some number, we have to compare each combination. If there are N numbers, there will be N(N-1)/2 pairs that need to be checked, so the runtime for this function is O(N^2).

```python
def check_sum(numbers, threshold):
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(len(numbers)):
            if not numbers[i] == numbers[j]: # don't compare each number with itself.
                if is_close(numbers[i], numbers[j], threshold):
                    return True

    return False
```

# POSTCONDITION

If two numbers are close, then we know that their sum must be some value. This value can be written as the sum of those two numbers plus some number, so this number is also within range. We'll use the same epsilon value for both checks.

```python
def check_sum(numbers, threshold):
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(len(numbers)):
            if not numbers[
