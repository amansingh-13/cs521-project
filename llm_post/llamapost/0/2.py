You have the following code context, function stub and natural language specification (in the form of a code comment) for has_close_elements. When implemented, the function should comply with this natural language specification:
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    False
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
    True
    """

Write a symbolic postcondition for has_close_elements consisting of exactly one assert statement. For variables, use only the function input parameters and a hypothetical return value, which we'll assume is stored in a variable return_val. If the postcondition calls any functions external to the program context, they should only be those from the functional subset of python. Although the postcondition should be less complex than the function itself, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function without implementing the function. The format of your response should be:
```CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION WITH ASSERT HERE```
Also submit a .py file with all the code for this problem, including the postcondition. Make sure to check that it works! You'll need to have at least one assert statement in your postcondition. If it doesn't work, you may get 0 points for this question.

## Part II: Post-conditions in a more real world setting (30 marks)
You are given the code for this python script, which reads all lines of text from stdin and outputs the number of words:
```python
import sys

for line in sys.stdin:
    for word in line.split():
        print(word)
```
Write a postcondition that ensures that this program will do what it claims to do, as described in the comments (the number printed at the end is the correct answer):
```python
...
print(len(words))
```
This code snippet needs to be inserted before ```print(word)```. This should be a postcondition for ```main()```, which you can assume is in the same file as the code you are writing. Assume this program is running on an ordinary computer, not some weird quantum computer that reads minds or something silly like that.

## Part III: An exercise in the real world (35 marks)
You are given the following C++ class:
```c++
#include <deque>
using namespace std;
class Queue{
    private:
        deque<int> _queue;
    public:
        void push(const int& val){_queue.push_back(val);}
        const int pop(){_queue.pop_front();return _queue.front();}
        bool empty() {return _queue.empty();}
};
```
Write a postcondition that asserts that this class works correctly,
