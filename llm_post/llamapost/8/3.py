You have the following code context, function stub and natural language specification (in the form of a code comment) for sum_product. When implemented, the function should comply with this natural language specification:
from typing import List, Tuple


def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """ For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.
    >>> sum_product([])
    (0, 1)
    >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
    (10, 24)
    """

Write a symbolic postcondition for sum_product consisting of exactly one assert statement. For variables, use only the function input parameters and a hypothetical return value, which we'll assume is stored in a variable return_val. If the postcondition calls any functions external to the program context, they should only be those from the functional subset of python. Although the postcondition should be less complex than the function itself, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function without implementing the function. The format of your response should be:
```CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION WITH ASSERT HERE```
